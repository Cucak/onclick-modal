                        Engineering at Protocol Labs is not just about writing world-class code. We create software
                        systems that tackle significant challenges. We aim to solve those challenges with new
                        technology breakthroughs and great user experience design. We believe in an open-source
                        approach to creation. We strike a balance between pragmatism, deeply informed protocol design,
                        and strict application of strong engineering principles. All of this happens in an environment
                        defined by curiosity, passion, and a love for open source.

                        HERC's mission is to improve humanity’s most important technology, the Internet. We build
                        protocols, systems, and tools to improve how it works. Today, we are focused on how we store,
                        locate, and move information. Our projects include IPFS, Filecoin, libp2p, and more.<br>
                        As a distributed team, we hire anywhere in the world, and at different levels of experience
                        (entry, senior, staff). We look for people with unique perspectives and diverse backgrounds.
